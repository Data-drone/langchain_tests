# MAGIC ## Generate API tokens
# MAGIC For many of the services that we'll using in the notebook, we'll need some API keys. Follow the instructions below to generate your own. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Hugging Face Hub
# MAGIC 1. Go to this [Inference API page](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) and click "Sign Up" on the top right.

# MAGIC 2. Once you have signed up and confirmed your email address, click on your user icon on the top right and click the `Settings` button. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Navigate to the `Access Token` tab and copy your token.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Let's ensure that we were able to get the PDFs from arXiv
display(dbutils.fs.ls(f'dbfs:/home/{username}/pdf_data'))

# COMMAND ----------

# As a first step we need to load and parse the document

loader = PyPDFLoader(file_to_load)
# This splits it into pages
pages = loader.load_and_split()

# COMMAND ----------

# We will view the page and decide what to do with it
# We can see that we get a list of Langchain document objects
page_0 = pages[0]
type(page_0)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md We are going to the ```CharacterTextSplitter``` from LangChain to split this document. LangChain has many text splitters, see [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/#text-splitters) for a complete list. This splits only on one type of character (defaults to ```"\n\n"```).

# COMMAND ----------

# We will feed all pages in
# chunk_size is a key parameter.
# For more advanced use we may want to tune this or use a paragraph splitter or something else
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Use Chroma wth LangChain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We utilise the ```HuggingFaceEmbeddings()``` from LangChain which defaults to ```sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2``` to generate our text embeddings. However, note that Chroma can handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically for you. If you would like to change the embedding model, read [here on how to do that](https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings). You will need instantiate the ```collection``` yourself instead of using the LangChain wrapper.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can read the documentate [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/integrations/chroma) to learn more about how Chroma integrates with LangChain.

# COMMAND ----------

embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings)

# we can verify that our docsearch index has objects in it with this
print('The index includes: {} documents'.format(docsearch._collection.count()))

# COMMAND ----------

docsearch

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Verify that the index is working

# We want to quickly verify as with the pace these libraries evolve, things can break often
query = "What is important to have open LLMs?"

docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Although we can get results from Chroma, it's often useful to metadata as well as ids to our partitions of texts (or embedding vectors). Often we don't want to query the entire vector database. This use-case is addressed below.

# COMMAND ----------

for t in texts: 
  t.metadata = {"source": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07306"}

print(texts[0].metadata)

# COMMAND ----------

docsearch_metadata = (
  Chroma.from_documents(
    collection_name="single_paper",
    documents=texts,
    ids=[f"id{x}" for x in range(len(texts))],
    embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
  )
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Now we can query the vector store and filter on a specific metadata condition

# COMMAND ----------

docs = (
  docsearch_metadata.similarity_search(
    query="What is important to have open LLMs?",
    filter={"source": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07306"})
)

docs[0].metadata

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC We can also query our Vector DB and retrieve a tuple of (result, score) so we can have a measure of confidence from the returned results. The returned value is a similarity score between the vector corresponding to the query and the vector for the returned document. Lower scores imply that the vectors are closer together and hence have higher relevance with the query vector.

# COMMAND ----------

docs = docsearch_metadata.similarity_search_with_score("What is important to have open LLMs?")
scores = [d[1] for d in docs]
print(scores)

# COMMAND ----------
